#  Who we are
Necroscos Foundation is a non-profit organization that promotes Science, Technology and Architecture. Necroscos Foundation will introduce to Planet Mars the most advanced technologies through developing new cities and conducting various programs that will bring knowledge, wealth, and prosperity to its.
Necroscos is an innovative, dynamic, and high tech center which specializes in research, creation, development, and management of technological innovations and urban planning on Planet Mars.  

# Motto
We are Necroscos! We do not just dream, we create!

# Mission
We are a team of young researchers and professionals from various fields, united by love and fascination for the universe. Our goal is to create a model of sustainable development on Mars, which will ensure that the planet can support life in a comfortable way.

# Introduction
Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System after Mercury. In English, Mars carries a name of the Roman god of war, and is often referred to as the "Red Planet"[14][15] because the iron oxide prevalent on its surface gives it a reddish appearance that is distinctive among the astronomical bodies visible to the naked eye. Mars is a terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere, having surface features reminiscent both of the impact craters of the Moon and the valleys, deserts, and polar ice caps of Earth.

The days and seasons are likewise comparable to those of Earth because Mars's rotational period is close to that of Earth's. Mars is home to Olympus Mons, the largest volcano as well as Valles Marineris, one of the largest canyons in the Solar System. The smooth Borealis basin in the northern hemisphere covers 40% of Mars's surface and may be a giant impact feature. Mars has two moons, Phobos and Deimos, which are small and irregularly shaped. These may be captured asteroids, similar to 5261 Eureka, a Martian trojan asteroid.[16]

There are ongoing investigations assessing the past habitability potential of Mars,[17][18]

The Necroscos Center for Research, Creation, Development, and Management of Technological Innovations and Urban Planning on Planet Mars is an initiative that aims to help the planet Mars become a more livable place for its inhabitants. It seeks to develop new technologies that make it easier for Martian people to live on the planet and enhance their quality of life. The center will also work on urban planning initiatives aimed at making neighborhoods safer and more accessible for all citizens.

Sure, Mars may be the red planet. But with the work that the Necroscos Institute is doing it's becoming more and more greenâ€”both in terms of sustainability and color.

The Necroscos Institute is a research institute that works towards the creation, development and management of technological innovations and urban planning on Planet Mars. We're particularly interested in making sure that our research is as sustainable as possible, so we're always looking for new ways to design our experiments to minimize their impact on the environment.

That means that not only are we interested in how to go green with your electricity usage and carbon footprint, but also how to make your life easier, healthier, and more fun with the power of technology. That's why we're focused on things like building an augmented reality helmet that lets you experience the world through a dog's eyes. We take pride in combining advanced technology with a sense of playfulness and innovation, so you can live life in a way that's comfortable for you!

# Value proposition 
The Necroscos Research Center is a privately funded research organization, with globe-wide scientific, technical and technological development activities, in the field of innovative energy sources in all its diverse forms of application, from the very theoretical to the experimental level of scientific models, at small or large scale, experimental prototypes and pilot plants up to full-blown production plants with very high energy generating efficiency. The Necroscos Research Center is also engaged in development, through innovative technology of processes for production and use of various forms of renewable energy (water, solar, wind and thermo-geopower), transforming them into various substances with superior value on mass production scale.
